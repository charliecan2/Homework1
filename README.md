# Horiseon Rework

## Description

My goal in reworking this html document was to make Horiseon's website more accessible and functional while keeping the basic structure of the source code in tact.

## Changes

Most of the modifications involved replacing many < div > tags with other HTML elements relevant to the structure of the site. One link on the header was fixed by adding the appropriate class to the main body. Other changes inlcuded cleaning up the CSS file linked the Horiseon's HTML. Some redundant classes were combined into one.

## Takeaways

Too many < div > tags aren't helpful when trying to navigate through the source code. It's very helpful to use relevant HTML elements so others can navigate through the code when they inspect it; or even when the orignal coder takes another look at it after a long time. When it comes to CSS, it makes sense to create a class to apply repeating elements in your desired HTML document. It, however, doesn't make sense to create multiple classes with the exact same CSS elements.
